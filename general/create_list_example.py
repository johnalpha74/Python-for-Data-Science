# Python program to demonstrate
# Creation of List
# Creating a List in Python
# Lists in Python can be created by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets[].
# Unlike Sets, a list doesnâ€™t need a built-in function for its creation of a list.
# Note: Unlike Sets, the list may contain mutable elements.
# Python lists need not to be homogenous

# Creating a List

#Empty list
my_list = []
print("The list is empty: ")
print(my_list)

# Number list in the multiples of 3
my_number_list = [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 21, 24]
length_of_list = len(my_number_list)
print("\nNumber list in the multiples of 3")
print(my_number_list)
print("\nThe number of items in the number list are :")
print(length_of_list)
